# CARAXES - Linux Kernel Module Rootkit

CARAXES - ***C**yber **A**nalytics **R**ootkit for **A**utomated and **X**ploratory **E**valuation **S**cenarios* - is a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) rootkit.
The purpose is to hide processes and files on a system, this can be done via user/group ownership or a magic-string in the filename.
Caraxes was developted for Linux versions 6 and up, and has been tested for 5.14-6.11,
it uses [ftrace-hooking](https://github.com/ilammy/ftrace-hook) at its core.
The rootkit was born to evaluate anomaly detection approaches based on kernel function timings - check out [this repository](https://github.com/ait-aecid/rootkit-detection-ebpf-time-trace) for details.

## Compilation

Install the kernel headers (`apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)` / `yum install kernel-headers` / `pacman -S linux-headers`).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ait-aecid/caraxes.git
$ cd caraxes/
$ make
```

This gives you the `caraxes.ko` kernelobject file, which can be loaded via `insmod caraxes.ko`. Remove it via `rmmod caraxes`, given it is not hidden (see `hide_module()`).

### Try it out

To test the rootkit, try to run `ls` in the directory - you should see several files as depicted below. Run `sudo insmod caraxes.ko` to load the rootkit into the kernel. Now, run `ls` again - all files that contain the magic word "caraxes" are hidden from the user. To make the files visible, just remove the rootkit from the kernel using `sudo rmmod caraxes`.

```sh
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/caraxes$ ls
LICENSE         README.md   caraxes.mod    caraxes.o         hooks.h             modules.order

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/caraxes$ make clean
```

## Configuration

The magic word that determines whether a file is hidden by the rootkit or not is defined in variable `MAGIC_WORD` in the file `rootkit.h`; by default, the magic word is "caraxes". This file also allows to set the variables `USER_HIDE` and `GROUP_HIDE`, which can be used to hide files or processes that belong to the specified user or group. By default, files and processes of user `1001` and group `21` (fax) are hidden.

Optionally, uncomment the `hide_module()` in `caraxes.c` to unlink the module from the modules list. Note that the name of the module that you load (`caraxes.ko`) has to contain the magic word (it does by default), otherwise it will show up under `/sys/modules`.
If it is hidden like this, it can not be unloaded via `rmmod` anymore.
You have to make sure to be able to trigger a `show_module()` [somehow](https://codeberg.org/sw1tchbl4d3/generic-linux-rootkit/src/branch/main/examples).

Another option is to switch from `getdents` hooking to `filldir` hooking by commenting and uncommenting the respective lines in `hooks.h`.
Those are different functions inside the kernel, that can be wrapped to get rootkit functionality.
We implemented different versions to test our [rootkit detection](https://github.com/ait-aecid/rootkit-detection-ebpf-time-trace).

## Troubleshooting

Keep in mind that if you unlink the module from the modules list (uncommenting of `hide_module()`), then `rmmod` will not find it and you will have to somehow signal to the rootkit to unhide itself with `show_module()`. If you get into that situation and the unhide does not work, or the kernel module crashed on `rmmod` or similar, a system restart should always do the trick.

If you want to extend the code, the easiest way is to debug the code is to uncomment the calls to `rk_info` and `printk` or add your own, then monitor dmesg on insert / remove with `sudo dmesg -w`.

## Missing Features: Open Ports

`/proc/net/{tcp,udp}` list open ports in a single file instead of one by port.
This can be addressed either by mangling with the `read*` syscalls or `tcp4_seq_show()`, which fills the content of this file.
Additionally, `/sys/class/net` shows statistics of network activity, which could hint to an open port.
Also `getsockopt` would fail when trying to bind to an open port - we would kind of have to flee, give up our port,
and start using a different one.
